# WEEK `11`: 16 APRIL 2018
##  Special Topics: Final Project Mid-term reviews
<!-- ##  Special Topics: Bias, Testing, and Community -->

This week in Quant Humanists, we are going to do a group feedback session for our upcoming final projects (next week!). 

<!-- 
we will have a look at how we evaluate ourselves, from which lenses we see ourselves and the world, how data can reinforce or upend our biases, and what it means scope our self-analyses so that they are accessible and understandable to others in the community. 
 -->
