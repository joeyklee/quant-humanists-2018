# WEEK `08`: 26 MARCH 2018
##  Special Topics: Biomedicalization in Practice + Guest Speaker Brian Bot

This week in Quant Humanists, we will take a look at the ever growing area of biomedicalization and its relationship to self-tracking. We will discuss stories of success and failure as new technologies pave the way for new actors to get involved in aspects of personal health in ways that were not possible before. Who is positively and negatively affected by over- and under- regulation of this industry? What are the potential benefits and dangers of these emerging services? In which directions are laws and regulations currently moving and how are people and organizations adapting?

We will hear from [Brian Bot](https://brian-bot.github.io/) on some of these issues.

We will also hear from [Daniel Goddemeyer](http://danielgoddemeyer.com/), principal of [OFFC](http://www.offc.co/web/about.php) about the [ethics of future products](https://interaction18.ixda.org/program/talk-imperfect-futures---the-hidden-ethics-of-tomorrows-products-goddemeyer-daniel/#speaker)
