# WEEK `03`: 5 Feb 2018
##  Reflect: Visualization, Representation, and Analysis
This week in Quant Humanists we will be thinking about the role of visualization and representation as a way to learn about yourself. In a [2013 Pew Research Center Internet & American Life Project Survey](http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2013/PIP_TrackingforHealth%2520with%2520appendix.pdf), it was found that 69 % of Americans keep track of health data for themselves or another person, of this 47% do this tracking “in their heads,” 33% on pen and paper, and 20% via a digital surrogate or technology. We look at various methods for getting to know yourself through your data such as through hand drawn visualizations, digital/interactive charts and maps, and alternative expressions of data.

## ASSIGNMENT

This week you will, with a partner, embrace your inner Lupi-Posavek and "Dear Data" a feature of your life that might be illuminated through visualization.

### Dear Data Visualization 

- **About**: Using "dear data" as a guide, create a set of rules to visualize your data - you may use digital tools, but analog style is encouraged. Think about the ways in which Georgia and Stefanie parameterized the aspects of their records to produce their visualizations. Find ways to express your own personal style and aesthetic in the implementation of your rules. 
- **Submission**: Document your process and submit **images of your output** along with the accompanying **description of your visualization** and post your Github Gist/blog post link as a [`comment in its respective github issue` in the quant-humanists-2018 repository](https://github.com/joeyklee/quant-humanists-2018/issues). See NOTE below.

from the [FiveThirtyEight Dear Data Feature](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-data-and-fivethirtyeight-want-you-to-visualize-your-podcast-habits/):

```
If you want to take part, keep in mind the basic rules of the Dear Data series:

    - The front of your postcard should only feature the visualization.
    - On the reverse, include a legend to explain your work.
    - You can use any shapes, colors, or materials you want, just as long as it fits on a postcard. But be creative! Can you move beyond a bar chart?
```

### Blog Post: Reflection
- **About**: short paragraph or phrase on what you learned this week.
- **Submission**: Submit your Github Gist/blog post link as a [`comment in its respective github issue` in the quant-humanists-2018 repository](https://github.com/joeyklee/quant-humanists-2018/issues). See NOTE below.


**NOTE**: Please structure your blog post submissions according to the assignment template here: [Quant Humanist - assignment template](https://github.com/joeyklee/quant-humanists-2018/blob/master/_templates/assignment-submission-template.md)
