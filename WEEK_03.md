# WEEK `03`: 5 Feb 2018
##  Reflect: Visualization, Representation, and Analysis
This week in Quant Humanists we will be thinking about the role of visualization and representation as a way to learn about yourself. In a [2013 Pew Research Center Internet & American Life Project Survey](http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2013/PIP_TrackingforHealth%2520with%2520appendix.pdf), it was found that 69 % of Americans keep track of health data for themselves or another person, of this 47% do this tracking “in their heads,” 33% on pen and paper, and 20% via a digital surrogate or technology. We look at various methods for getting to know yourself through your data such as through hand drawn visualizations, digital/interactive charts and maps, and alternative expressions of data.
