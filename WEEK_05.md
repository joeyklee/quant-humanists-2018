# WEEK `05`: 26 Feb 2018
##  Act: Interventions
This week in Quant Humanists, we will look into the things that motivate behavior change. We will look into digital and physical interventions that are meant to keep us engaged, on track, on schedule, or empowered to make a change in our lives. Which interventions personally work for us? Which ones don’t? How can we use new technologies or relationships to create impactful interventions?

## ASSIGNMENT

This week your assignment is to design a quantified self intervention. In this case, an intervention can any kind of trigger (e.g. push notifications, phone calls from friends, money donations or deductions) that helps to keep you on track with your habits, provides motivation, punishes you, etc. Think about the deeper underlying principles that motivate you, how various services play on those principles, and how you might (ab)use those principles in your own intervention design. 

### Quant Self Intervention
- **About**:  
-  Design or prototype an intervention that would help you to change your behavior based on the data you've gathered. Tech or community or social based interventions are fair game.
-  You will:
    - make your intervention tangible; make it visual or physical in some way. 
    - justify how your intervention works and why it is convinving for you and why it might (or might not) be a useful strategy for others.

You might consider: 
    - paper prototypes, a slide deck, a screen dummy, video, etc
    - using your quant self service idea as a foundation to build your intervention on

- **Submission**: Submit documentation of your quant self intervention - including images, graphics, text descriptions, etc - as a Github Gist/blog post link as a [`comment in its respective github issue` in the quant-humanists-2018 repository](https://github.com/joeyklee/quant-humanists-2018/issues). See NOTE below.
- You will present your concept next class, convince us!


### Blog Post: Reflection
- **About**: short paragraph or phrase on what you learned this week.
- **Submission**: Submit your Github Gist/blog post link as a [`comment in its respective github issue` in the quant-humanists-2018 repository](https://github.com/joeyklee/quant-humanists-2018/issues). See NOTE below.
