# WEEK `05`: 26 Feb 2018
##  Act: Interventions
This week in Quant Humanists, we will look into the things that motivate behavior change. We will look into digital and physical interventions that are meant to keep us engaged, on track, on schedule, or empowered to make a change in our lives. Which interventions personally work for us? Which ones don’t? How can we use new technologies or relationships to create impactful interventions?
