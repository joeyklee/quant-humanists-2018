# WEEK `10`: 9 April 2018
##  Special Topics: The Value of You

This week in Quant Humanists, we will discuss the value of you and your data. We will take a thoughtful look into data sharing and publishing and privacy. Here we will examine the various ways our personal data is used for and against us and strategies for protecting our privacy (e.g. obfuscation) while still accessing the services that help us make sense of our lives.
