##  Field Trip: Biomedicalization in Practice + Jason Bobe & Ryan Viglizzo

This week in Quant Humanists, we go to visit [Jason Bobe](http://www.jasonbobe.net/about.html) and [Ryan Viglizzo](http://hd2i.org/about-us.html#) at Mount Sinai Health System. Jason is a biomedical research producer and head of the Resilience Project, among many things. Ryan Viglizzo is a designer (ITP Alum) currently bringing design methods into the field of biomedical research. Together, Jason and Ryan are working together to develop new methods to make biomedical research easier to implement for practitioners and easier for participants to join - e.g. through new digital consent processes and delightful digital experiences. Precision and personalized medicine will not look the same!
