# WEEK `04`: 12 Feb 2018
##  Reflect: Quant Self as a Service
This week in Quant Humanists, we will look into the service of self-tracking. What do people’s journeys look like through the process of self-tracking? Who are the actors involved? What does engagement look like from the perspective of the product or software company or the quant self community? We will take the services we have been using as examples to understand the “quantified self as a service” and design a service concept around the insights and data we’ve been tracking. 

## PROGRAM

**DISCUSSION**:
 
- Review of Week 3 Assignments
- Updates on class’s data collection, positives, pain-points, debugging, and more.

**STUDIO**:

- Collaborate in groups and with the class on a primer on service design concepts: user journey exercises, concept mapping. Consider how you might model a service around your data, or how you might expand a quant-self project to a quant-community project.

## ASSIGNMENT

For the next two weeks you will use your insights from your personal data tracking, any primary and secondary research, and awareness you've gained so far in the course to deliver a convincing service concept and design. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from some of the critical work we've seen thus far in the course and approach the brief using interdisciplinary perspectives and methods. 


You will have 2 weeks to complete this assignment. **NOTE: PRESIDENT’S DAY IS OBSERVED NEXT WEEK - NO CLASS ON 19 FEB 2018**

### Quant Self Service
- **About**:  Develop a service concept around your own personal data. You might consider designing or imagining new ways of tracking your data, visualizing or providing feedback to yourself, or changing your behavior. Consider integrating some current or emerging technologies that might make your service something possible now or in the near future. Also consider community based or less technical approaches to build out your service concept. It is encouraged to prototype an aspect of your service or a video showcasing a scenario in which your service might operate to help make your idea more tangible.
- **Submission**: Submit documentation of your quant self service - including images, graphics, text descriptions, etc - as a Github Gist/blog post link as a [`comment in its respective github issue` in the quant-humanists-2018 repository](https://github.com/joeyklee/quant-humanists-2018/issues). See NOTE below.


### Blog Post: Reflection
- **About**: short paragraph or phrase on what you learned this week.
- **Submission**: Submit your Github Gist/blog post link as a [`comment in its respective github issue` in the quant-humanists-2018 repository](https://github.com/joeyklee/quant-humanists-2018/issues). See NOTE below.


**NOTE**: Please structure your blog post submissions according to the assignment template here: [Quant Humanist - assignment template](https://github.com/joeyklee/quant-humanists-2018/blob/master/_templates/assignment-submission-template.md)
