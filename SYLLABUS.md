## MATERIALS

See <a href="MATERIALS.md" target="_blank">MATERIALS</a> for details on course materials such as readings, watchables, inspiration, quantified self apps and additional resources.


## DESCRIPTION

There are more ‚Äúfree‚Äù applications and services than ever before that help us to quantify and track what we do, when, how, and with whom. The quantified self holds the promise of improving our lives, but there is an ambivalence to how these technologies are affecting our lives. This course will examine, question, and critique the perspectives of personal data and ‚Äúthe quantified self‚Äù from multiple perspectives. We will explore these perspectives by working with the tools and methodologies for collecting personal data and generate visuals and other tangible output from these data. We will introduce students to guest speakers, review and critique readings, projects, and software around the quantified self, and experiment through lab-based exercises that encourage a fluency with digital and analog visualization and data tracking tools.

In this 12 week course, students will explore the topic of ‚Äúthe quantified self‚Äù. Together we will learn how to create narratives from our own personal data by collecting, retrieving, and analyzing patterns in our data, sketching and designing visualizations (e.g. charts, maps, etc), and developing programmatic methods to generate output from these data.

Students will: 
1. Learn to navigate Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and databases that allow for creation and retrieval of personal data
2. Practice various programmatic methods for analyzing and visualizing individual data
3. Build visualizations and other creative output using their own data 

By working with and visualizing their own quantified self, students will: 
1.  Be exposed to the debates around personal data
2. Gain an understanding of the implications of personal data vis-√†-vis privacy
3. Learn to better understand the ways personal data can help or harm individuals
4. Have an awareness for the landscape of quantified self initiatives across domains (e.g. from medicine to sex to eating)


## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

- Exposure to techniques for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing personal data
- Become conversational in the discussion around the quantified self movement (who‚Äôs who, what‚Äôs what, the history, ambivalence). 
- Create visualizations (or other tangible output) that represents the student‚Äôs own relationship personal data 
- ‚ÄúFind yourself‚Äù in the data your produce -- how does it represent you? How does it not?

## GRADING

Students will be evaluated on effort, personal progress and growth, class participation, assignments, and the final project. It is understood that coding is tough and you may be new to this, you will be graded on your progress throughout the class, your ability to complete assignments on time, your interaction with peer reviewers, and your ability to justify your decisions thoughtfully.

GRADE CALCULATION:
Here is a basic breakdown of graded tasks along that trajectory:
* 10% Attendance/Participation
* 30% Assignments
* 20% Project Proposal
* 40% Final Project, completed on conclusion of the course
* TOTAL: 100%

## NYU STATEMENTS AND PRINCIPLES
### STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Plagiarism is presenting someone else‚Äôs work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer‚Äôs work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

### STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE 
The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.  For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook, which can be found online at: http://students.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html

If you experience any health or mental health issues during this course, we encourage you to utilize the support services of the 24/7 NYU Wellness Exchange 212-443-9999. Also, all students who may require an academic accommodation due to a qualified disability, physical or mental, please register with the Moses Center 212-998-4980. Please let your instructor know if you need help connecting to these resources.

### STATEMENT ON USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES 
Laptops will be an essential part of the course and may be used in class during workshops and for taking notes in lecture. Laptops must be closed during class discussions and student presentations.
