# WEEK `07`: 19 Mar 2018
##  Special Topics: Tracking at Scale

This week in Quant Humanists, we will be exploring the domain of forced tracking and tracking at scale. We will examine situations when tracking is not a choice, but rather imposed on individuals through various institutions/organizations (e.g. via employers) and the implications of such granular tracking.

## ASSIGNMENT

This week your assignment is obfuscate your date, or circumvent your trackers. 
1. Obfuscate data/circumvention collection assignment. Develop a method to hack one (or more) of your tracking apps. Software or hardware solutions or a combo of both are welcome. Document your process. Write a short reflection about your hack - how did you do it? What information is gained or lost? What are the implications of hacking your data in the way that you did? 
2. Make an instructable about your hack (e.g. http://www.instructables.com/id/DNA-Spoofing-DIY-Counter-Surveillance/)
